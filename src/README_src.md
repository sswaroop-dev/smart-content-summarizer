# Technical Documentation: Smart Content Summarizer

## Code Structure

The main implementation is in `content_summarizer.py` which contains several key components:

### 1. Text Processing Components

```python
# Core text processing functions
create_frequency_table()     # Creates word frequency distribution
create_frequency_matrix()    # Creates sentence-word frequency matrix
```

These functions handle the initial text processing using NLTK for tokenization and stop word removal.

### 2. TF-IDF Implementation

```python
create_tf_matrix()          # Term Frequency calculation
create_idf_matrix()         # Inverse Document Frequency calculation
create_tf_idf_matrix()      # Combines TF and IDF scores
```

The TF-IDF implementation helps identify important sentences by:
- Calculating term frequency in each sentence
- Determining inverse document frequency across all sentences
- Combining these metrics to score sentence importance

### 3. Summarization Logic

```python
score_sentences()           # Calculates importance score for each sentence
find_average_score()        # Determines threshold for sentence inclusion
generate_summary()          # Creates final summary based on scores
```

Key features of the summarization:
- Customizable summary length via SUMMARY_LENGTH_FACTOR
- Preservation of key information through statistical scoring
- Maintains context through sentence selection

### 4. Speech Recognition Integration

```python
# Speech input handling
with sr.Microphone() as source:
    audio = r.listen(source)
    text = r.recognize_google(audio)
```

The speech recognition component:
- Uses Google's Speech Recognition API
- Provides real-time transcription
- Includes error handling for audio issues

### 5. Search Functionality

```python
get_top_relevant_links_from_summary()    # Finds related references
```

Search implementation includes:
- RAKE algorithm for keyword extraction
- TF-IDF based search query generation
- Google search integration for references

## Customization Parameters

```python
SUMMARY_LENGTH_FACTOR = 1.1    # Adjust summary length
DEFAULT_NUM_LINKS = 3          # Number of reference links
DEFAULT_NUM_KEYWORDS = 2       # Keywords for search
MIN_KEYWORD_LENGTH = 3         # Minimum length for keywords
```

## Data Flow

1. Input Processing:
   - Text input or Speech recognition
   - Text cleanup and normalization

2. Analysis:
   - Sentence tokenization
   - Word frequency calculation
   - TF-IDF scoring

3. Summary Generation:
   - Sentence scoring
   - Threshold calculation
   - Summary composition

4. Additional Processing:
   - Keyword extraction
   - Reference search
   - Result formatting

## Dependencies Management

Key library dependencies:
- NLTK: Text processing and analysis
- SpeechRecognition: Audio input handling
- scikit-learn: TF-IDF calculations
- rake-nltk: Keyword extraction

## Error Handling

The code includes error handling for:
- Speech recognition failures
- Invalid input text
- Network issues during search
- Missing dependencies

## Performance Considerations

- Uses efficient data structures for frequency calculations
- Implements lazy loading for NLTK resources
- Optimizes memory usage in matrix operations
- Includes rate limiting for API calls

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
1. Add support for different languages
2. Implement more summarization algorithms
3. Add document type detection
4. Enhance keyword extraction accuracy
5. Implement caching for API calls
