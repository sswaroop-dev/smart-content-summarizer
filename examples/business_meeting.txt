Good morning everyone. Today we'll discuss our Q4 performance and strategic plans for the upcoming year. Our sales team has exceeded expectations with a 15% growth in revenue compared to last quarter. Key achievements include securing three major enterprise clients and expanding our presence in the Asian market.

The customer success team reports a 95% satisfaction rate, with particularly positive feedback on our new product features. However, we've identified some areas for improvement in our response time to technical support tickets.

Looking ahead, we're planning to:
1. Launch two new product features in Q1 2025
2. Expand our technical support team by 25%
3. Implement an AI-driven customer service chatbot
4. Open new offices in Singapore and Berlin

Budget allocations have been adjusted to accommodate these initiatives, with a 30% increase in R&D spending and a 20% increase in hiring budget.

Any questions or concerns about these plans should be directed to your department heads by end of week.
